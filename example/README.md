# PWAKit Example

This directory contains a minimal example PWA that demonstrates PWAKit's native module integration.

## Running the Example

1. Start the local HTTPS server:
   ```bash
   make example
   # Or directly: node example/server.js
   ```

2. Configure PWAKit to use the example:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/configure.sh --name "PWAKit Example" --url "https://localhost:8443" --bundle-id "com.example.pwakit"
   ```

3. Build and run in Xcode (`Cmd+R`)

## Development Certificates

The `localhost+1.pem` and `localhost+1-key.pem` files are **development-only** self-signed certificates for running the example server over HTTPS locally.

### Important Notes

- These certificates are generated by [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) for local development
- They are valid only for `localhost` and should **never** be used in production
- They are intentionally excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- If missing, regenerate them with:
  ```bash
  # Install mkcert if needed
  brew install mkcert
  mkcert -install

  # Generate certificates
  cd example
  mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1
  ```

### Why HTTPS?

iOS requires HTTPS for many web features including:
- Service Workers
- Push Notifications
- Geolocation
- Camera/Microphone access

The development certificates allow testing these features locally without deploying to a real server.
